# Cricket Match Win Predictor

This project analyzes ball-by-ball data from ODI cricket matches to extract insightful features and build a machine learning-based win prediction system. It uses historical match data to train two models:

### Approach

1. **Pre-Match Predictor**
   This model uses pre-match features such as teams, venue, and toss outcome to predict the *expected winner* before the match begins. It is trained on historical matches and captures general team strengths and situational context.

2. **Ball-by-Ball Predictor**
   The second model takes the *expected winner* as an input and dynamically updates the win probability after every ball using real-time match data. This model is trained on delivery-level data and adapts to the changing match situation.

### Project Structure

* `Creating Dataset.py`: Parses raw JSON files and generates delivery-level data with engineered features.
* `Datafiles/`: Directory containing raw match JSON files.
* `Dataset/`: Processed and feature-rich dataset ready for training or inference.
* `Models/`: Contains `.pkl` files for trained LightGBM models with high accuracy.
* `WinPredictionNotebook.ipynb`: Interactive notebook for training models or running inference.

### Extracted Features

The following features are extracted and computed from the match data:

| Feature                                            | Description                                                      |

### How to Use

1. Place raw JSON files in the `Datafiles/` directory.
2. Run `Creating Dataset.py` to parse and generate the processed dataset.
3. Train the models or run inference using the notebook (`WinPredictionNotebook.ipynb`).
4. Trained models are available in the `Models/` folder.

### Applications

* Predict match outcomes dynamically during a live match.
* Analyze momentum shifts through run rate trends.
* Evaluate pressure scenarios and turning points in the match.
* Provide real-time insights for broadcasters or viewers.
